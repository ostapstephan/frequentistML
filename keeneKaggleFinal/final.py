To get an A on this project, I'm going to request you do the following on this dataset.

Linear regression with L1 penalties
Linear regression with L2 penalties
Random Forest
XGBoost tree or something similar 
Try a dimensionality reduction method on all, or a subset of your data 	
Try a feature selection method.
Try one regression method that we *have not* covered in class.
Put these in Kaggle Kernels(can be one big one if you want) but don't make them public until after the competition is over.
