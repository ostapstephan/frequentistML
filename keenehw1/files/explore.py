This Project analyzes the bars in NYC 

I found a dataset which gave me the geographic locations of all of the bars in NYC. 
My ultimate goal was to find the best place to get an apartment if I wanted to be closest to the most amount of bars. 

My initial approach was to use the Mean Shift Clustering Algorithm. However the results werenâ€™t optimal as they only provided me with 3 points. Two which were too far and one that was in the east river. I had to change my approach.

The method that I ended up using was called K Means Clustering. This method allows me to specify how many clusters I would like then it iterates until it converges or runs the max allowable iterations. 

The clusters were then plotted by color and their centers shown in black.

In the future I hope to expand this to all bars in america if not the world. Initially i thought that i had found the data for the world that was 1.csv and 2.csv. But this was a very incomplete data set.
